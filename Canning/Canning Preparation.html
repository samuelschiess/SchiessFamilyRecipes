        Preparation for canning <br><br>

        Fill the canner (the big black pot with a lid and rack for bottles.  Some people also call it a “hot water bath") about 2/3 of the way to the top and place it on the stove on high with the lid on.  It takes quite a while to get it boiling so starting it first thing will give it time to get boiling good while you prepare your fruit. <br> <br>

        Estimate about how many bottles you will need for the amount of fruit or vegetables that you want to can. <br><br>

        Place that many bottles with their rings in the dishwasher and start it.  This will not only get the bottles nice and clean but will make the bottles hot and keep them hot until your fruit or vegetables are ready to put into the bottles. (NOTE:  If your bottles are not HOT enough when you put them into the canner, they will break!) <br><br>

        In a saucepan, place the same number of lids with water and boil them for 10 minutes to sterilize them. <br><br>

        When your fruit or vegetables are prepared and ready to process (meaning: seal the lids on hem by boiling the bottles in the canner), put the food into a hot bottle. Fill it up, leaving just ½” at the top.  You may need to use a funnel for this step. <br><br>

        Put the lids and rings on the bottles.  <br><br>

        Keep the bottles hot while you finish all the bottles or have 7 bottles (that is how many ca be processed at one time.) Keep them hot by either putting them back into a hot dishwasher that has finished running but is still warm or into a sink full of very hot water. <br><br>

        Place the bottles in the rack, put it into the boiling water with the lid on, and bring the water back to a strong boil.  Then start your timer and process them for 20 minutes.  (Do not take the lid off during this time or the bottle contents will bubble out.) <br><br>

        When the time is over, take the bottles out of the canner and let them cool on a towel.  They should seal as they cool.  <br><br>
        
        Write the date on the top of the lid and put them into your food storage. <br><br>
